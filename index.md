## About Me

Hi, I'm Hyelim Lim, a first year M.S. student in Artificial Inteligence Application at Hanyang University, supervised by Prof. Taeuk Kim and affiliated with the HYU NLP Lab.

## Research Interests

- **Mechanistic Interpretability:** I am interested in understanding how large language models acquire, represent, and process knowledge by analyzing their internal mechanisms and structures.
- **Long-term Memory:** I explore methods for equipping conversational agents with persistent memory, enabling them to recall and utilize past interactions over extended periods.
